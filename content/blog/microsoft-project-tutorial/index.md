## Introduction

In today’s academic and professional environments, effective **project management** is a vital skill. Whether you are managing a research project, software development, event planning, or IT deployment, using a structured tool like **Microsoft Project** can greatly enhance your planning, execution, and monitoring capabilities.

This tutorial provides a comprehensive walkthrough of **Microsoft Project** from a beginner’s perspective. You'll learn how to:

- Create a new project
- Structure tasks and subtasks
- Set durations and dependencies
- Create Gantt charts
- Identify the critical path
- Use milestones and constraints
- Monitor project progress

---

## What is Microsoft Project?

**Microsoft Project** is a project management software application developed by Microsoft. It allows users to:

- Plan and schedule projects
- Assign tasks and resources
- Track progress
- Manage budgets
- Visualize task dependencies

It is commonly used in industries such as engineering, construction, IT, business, and education.

## Step 1: Create a New Project

1. Launch **Microsoft Project**
2. Select **Blank Project**
3. In the ribbon, click **Project Information** and:
   - Set the **Start Date**
   - Choose the correct **Calendar Type**

**Screenshot Tip**:

_Show the Project Information popup with start date selected._

## Step 2: Add Tasks and Durations

In the **Gantt Chart** view (default), begin adding your tasks in the “Task Name” column.

For example:

| Task Name                  | Duration |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Initiation                | 2 days   |
| Planning                  | 4 days   |
| Implementation            | 5 days   |
| Testing & Evaluation      | 3 days   |
| Documentation             | 2 days   |
| Final Review & Closure    | 1 day    |

- Avoid assigning durations in hours unless the project requires hour-level detail.
- Use automatic scheduling for better timeline control.

## Step 3: Create Task Dependencies

Dependencies help MS Project calculate task timing and detect schedule delays. Most common is **Finish-to-Start (FS)**.

### How to Add Dependencies:

- In the “Predecessors” column, link task numbers:
   - Task 2 depends on Task 1 → Enter `1`
   - Task 3 depends on Task 2 → Enter `2`
- Or select a task → Click **Task → Link Tasks** (Ctrl + F2)

You can customize the relationship (FS, SS, FF, SF) and add lag/leads in **Task Information** → **Predecessors** tab.

## Step 4: Add Summary Tasks

As your project grows in size and complexity, it becomes essential to structure your tasks into meaningful **project phases**. Summary tasks serve as **parent containers** for related subtasks, allowing you to logically organize your project by stages like Planning, Execution, or Testing.
A **summary task**:

- Represents a phase or group of subtasks
- Automatically reflects the total duration and progress of its subtasks
- Collapses/expands for easier Gantt chart navigation

### How to Create a Summary Task

1. Insert a new task row where you want the summary to appear.
2. Type a **summary task name** (e.g., “Phase 1: Planning”).
3. Select all relevant subtasks below the summary row.
4. Click the **Indent** button in the Task tab, or press **Alt + Shift + →**.

MS Project will:

- Bold the summary task
- Automatically calculate start/end based on subtasks
- Show roll-up % complete and bar in the Gantt chart

**Screenshot Tip**:

## Step 5: Insert Milestones

Milestones are zero-duration checkpoints to mark key project events like:

- “Planning Completed”
- “Prototype Approved”
- “Project Handover”

### How to:

- Add a new task → Set **Duration = 0 days**
- Check **“Mark task as milestone”** under Task Information

They will appear as **black diamonds** in your Gantt chart.

## Step 6: Visualize the Gantt Chart

The **Gantt chart** gives a timeline view of all tasks, durations, dependencies, and milestones.

Use the **Zoom In/Out** slider to adjust view range.

Enhance visuals by:

- Coloring critical tasks
- Formatting gridlines
- Adding task notes

To highlight the critical path:

- Go to **Format → Check “Critical Tasks”**

Critical tasks will turn **red**.

**Screenshot Tip**:

---

## Step 7: Identify the Critical Path

The **Critical Path** is the sequence of tasks that determines the project’s minimum completion time. Any delay in this path delays the whole project.

To view it:

- Enable **“Critical Tasks”** in the Gantt Format tab
- Use the **Network Diagram** for logical flow
- Go to **View → More Views → Detail Gantt** for slack (float) visibility

**Screenshot Tip**:  
Highlight critical and non-critical tasks in color:

(Red lines are critical tasks and Blue lines are non-critical task/flooting tasks)

---

## Step 8: Use Constraints and Deadlines

Constraints allow you to lock specific dates:

- “Must Start On”
- “Finish No Later Than”

Add via **Task Information → Advanced Tab**

Use **Deadlines** to trigger alerts without constraining the schedule.

**Screenshot Tip**:  
Show constraint settings:

---

## Step 9: Track and Monitor Progress

Once execution begins:

- Use the **% Complete** column
- Update actual start/finish dates
- Track slippage or task delays

You can also:

- Save a **Baseline** to compare planned vs actual timelines
- Use **Tracking Gantt View** to see delays visually

**Screenshot Tip**:  
Show the Tracking Gantt view with variance:

## Best Practices

- Always define a clear WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)
- Link dependencies logically—not all tasks are sequential
- Avoid overuse of constraints; let MS Project handle flexibility
- Set realistic durations and buffers
- Review the critical path weekly
